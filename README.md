# Scenario  

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analytics team at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago. The marketing director believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team aims to understand the differences in how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes. With these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. However, before proceeding, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations; thus, you need to support your proposal with a compelling data-driven analysis and professional visualizations.  

## Characters and Teams  

- **Cyclistic**: A bike-sharing program with 5,800 bikes and 600 stations. Cyclistic stands out for offering not only traditional bikes but also recumbent bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, ensuring an inclusive experience for people with disabilities and riders unable to use a standard two-wheeled bike. While most riders choose traditional bikes, around 8% use assisted options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for recreational purposes, but approximately 30% use the service for daily commuting.  

- **Lily Moreno**: The marketing director and your manager. Moreno is responsible for developing campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-sharing program. These campaigns may include email marketing, social media, and other communication channels.  

- **Cyclistic Marketing Data Analytics Team**: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to guide Cyclistic’s marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals, as well as how you can contribute to achieving them from your role as a junior data analyst.  

- **Cyclistic Executive Team**: A highly detail-oriented team that will decide whether to approve the proposed marketing program.  

## About the Company  

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-sharing service. Since then, the program has expanded to a fleet of 5,824 geo-referenced bikes, accessible from 692 stations across Chicago. Bikes can be unlocked at one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.  

Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy has focused on building overall brand awareness and attracting a broad consumer base. One of the key factors enabling this was the flexibility of its pricing plans, which include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are classified as **casual riders**, while those who subscribe to annual memberships are referred to as **Cyclistic members**.  

Cyclistic’s financial analysts have concluded that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. While flexible pricing helps attract more customers, Moreno believes that increasing the number of annual members will be crucial for future growth. Rather than targeting all new customers with a marketing campaign, she sees strong potential in converting casual riders into annual members. She notes that casual riders are already familiar with Cyclistic and have chosen it for their mobility needs.  

Moreno has set a clear goal: **to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members**. However, to achieve this, the marketing analytics team needs to better understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, the factors that would encourage casual riders to purchase memberships, and how digital media could influence their decision-making. Moreno and her team are particularly interested in analyzing historical Cyclistic trip data to identify trends.  

## Key Questions  

Three main questions will guide the future marketing program:  

1. How do annual members and casual riders differ in their use of Cyclistic bikes?  
2. Why would casual riders choose to purchase an annual membership?  
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to encourage casual riders to become members?  

### Your Task  

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer:
